<body onload="initGame('canvas');">
   
   
<canvas id="canvas" width="640" height="800" >
</canvas>
   
   <br>how to play:
	<br><br>to start game press m, will be used to pause game 
	<br>usage: wsad or arrow keys to move,
	<br>space to shoot
	<br>e to switch weapons
	<br>f to upgrade weapon, currently unlimited, will use cost of resources eventually
	
	<br><br>initial upgrade cost per weapon, assume cost doubles after each upgrade
	<br>ammo:200, overall decent weapon, quick shooting, ok damage
	<br>laser:500 goes through non rock enemies and does major damage, but doesnt do well against rocks, worst shoot rate
	<br>missile:350 best against rocks, but slow initial shooting
	
	
	<br><br>enemies:
	<br>spammer: move in programmed movement, generally weak
	<br>follower:moves to hover above player, stronger than spammer
	<br>asteroid: circle rock that floats through space, avoid collision, may contain worm
	<br> enemy inside of worm, small chance of spawning, must destroy rock before you can damage worm
	<br>      rotates to player location, once free goes towards player
	
	
	
	
	<br><br>land on comets, semitransparent rock, to mine for resources, movement is limited to left and right, 
	<br> press x to disengage from comet when bar is passed the green portion
	<br> get rewarded with health when disengaging, but stay on the comet too long at it may explode and hurt you
	<br> every next comet should give more resources
	<br> otherwise killenemies to gain resources
